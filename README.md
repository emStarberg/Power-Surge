A 2D platformer about resource management, created in Godot

## Repository Rules
- Try not to push directly to main unless it is an edit to README .gitignore etc. Use a new branch when working on a feature and then merge
- Write descriptive commit messages, and reference any issues they contribute towards
- Remember to pull
- Let others know if you are making changes to a file that they could be working on simultaneously

## Writing Scripts in Godot
There shouldn't be any problems if both C# and GDScript are used over different files, use whichever you're most comfortable with

## Prototype
The prototype that this project is based on can be found here:
