## Other Info
Executable can be downloaded from: https://starberg.itch.io/power-surge-complete-edition

If you wish to try individual levels without having to progress through the whole game , I've added a cheat code. Press ctrl + shift + c while on the main menu/title screen to unlock every level. (After you've tried enough of it normally and had a look at the level unlock system, it can't be reversed)

If you close the game, settings should still be saved when you open it again.

## Discussion
**Strengths/Weaknesses:**

My game is strong from a practical point of view, programming is my specialty, so I think that’s where it shines. There will of course be some bugs here and there as I haven’t tested the final build very extensively, but I’ve sorted all the ones that I’m aware of.
I made a point of doing all the visuals myself to keep a consistent style. Pixel art is still very new to me and I’m well out of practice with art in general, so I’ll happily admit that the visuals are lacking in many ways. The story is by far the weakest point, I’m a terrible storyteller and it shows here. If I’d had some more time to make some more levels it may have helped flesh out the story a bit more. 
I believe that the level design is lacking in some ways too, especially the more linear ones. I was very happy with the gate puzzle and the lab boss though; it may have been good to lean into those aspects more.

**Communication Systems/Process Control**

There’s not much to say about communication as I was working by myself, but when I was expecting to be working with one other I did a number of things to help things run smoothly, including drawing a class diagram to keep us on the same page about structure, writing up an improved GDD, and splitting tasks into small issues that could be assigned through GitHub.

**Version Control**

I used GitHub for my version control; I made a branch for each feature I was developing and then merged that into main through a pull request. It was difficult to use GitHub to its full potential without any teammates. I used issues to keep track of what needed doing, this really helped me to remember bugs that I discovered or ideas I thought of while working on something else. I also made references to my issues in commits rather than updating/closing them manually. I used a milestone for the MVP.

**The Best Parts**

I actually enjoyed the balance between art and coding the most, normally I would only be coding while someone else oversees art. My favourite part of the game is the lab boss level, I was pretty pleased with myself getting it to form itself out of the lab equipment.
