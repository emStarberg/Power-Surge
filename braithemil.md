# Individual Contributions - Emily Braithwaite

I can claim “All” to every aspect of the project.

Some of the work I did:
-	Level selection / unlock system
-	A system where data about settings and progress persists between sessions after the game has been closed
-	Player movement/controls: Jump, Dash, Move, Attack
-	Enemies/enemy AI
-	A boss fight
-	Collectibles
-	Power meter system
-	Options menu with separate and combined volume options as well as key remapping
-	UI effects for menus
-	Animations for enemies, player, objects
-	A camera that changes viewpoints depending on what is needed for the level layout
-	A puzzle level with gates and switches
-	9 levels with (mostly) unique designs
-	UI button designs
-	Extensively tested to ensure balanced difficulty level
