Hamster|You see, every 100 million years it's my job to eradicate the majority of life on Earth.
Hamster|You see, it gets quite boring after a while and we like to see what new species will arise after a reset.

Archie|Every 100 million years huh? So you're responsible for Earth's mass extinctions?
Hamster|Yes, that's what you people call it
Hamster|Tell you what, if you leave me alone, I'll hold off another million years, how does that sound?
