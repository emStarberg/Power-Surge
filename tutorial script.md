# Tutorial Script

The player arrives in the simulation:

_controls are disabled until Lilah or Archie mentions them_

**Lilah**: Welcome to the simulation room, this isn't a real physical space, just a way to get you familiar with the controls for S.U.R.G.E.

**Lilah**: You can move left and right by either pressing A and D or the arrow keys, give it a try.

_player must press each of A and D (or arrow keys) to continue_

**Lilah**: Great, now try pressing W or the up arrow to jump.

_player must jump to continue_

**Archie**: You can also double jump by pressing the same key while in midair!

**Lilah**: Be careful. See that meter at the bottom of your screen>

**Lilah**: That's your power meter, actions like jumping decrease your power. If you run out, it's all over, so keep an eye on it.

**Archie**: Fortunately, those robots that keep showing up require power too, so it looks like The World Conductor has been giving them some supplies. You should use that to your advantage.

**Lilah**: That's right. If you need to get away in a hurry, there's also the dash feature. You can access it by pressing LSHIFT while moving.

_player must use dash to continue_

**Lilah**: Good job. Now you should know that we didn't leave S.U.R.G.E defenseless, you've got 3 attacks to choose from:

**Lilah**: Firstly there's the weak pulse, it doesn't cost much power to use but as the name implies, it is weak and only has a short range.

**Lilah**: Secondly, there's the strong blast. This one is a long ranged projectile that packs a bit of a punch, however it requires a lot of power.

**Lilah**: Lastly, there's the surround blast. This one is reasonably powerful, but with a lower cost than the strong blast... 

**Lilah**: It fires a round of short range projectiles in a ring around you.

**Lilah**: To cycle between these attacks, use [ and ]. You can see your selected attack in the bottom left corner of your screen.

**Lilah**: Press SPACE to use your selected attack. There are a few enemies scattered around for you to practice on.

_player must use an attack to continue_

**Archie**: Awesome work Felix, looks like you're almost ready to go. You can play around with the controls for as long as you like, just press the "Exit Simulation" button when you're ready to continue!

**Archie**: Wait! Before I forget, you can access the settings menu by pressing ESC. There are a few things you can change there, including key remapping if you don't like the way the controls feel!


## Notes

- After Lilah or Archie's explanation, another prompt will appear on the screen telling the player what to do.
- Keys can't be remapped until after the dialogue, but other settings are still available.
