Lilah| [name]! Hurry — get to the bunker!
Lilah| We don’t have long before they take over the building!
Lilah| [name]? Where are you?
Lilah| You’re in the bunker?
Lilah| I’m here with Archie, but we don’t see you…
Lilah| Hang on, I’ll put him on the hologram.
Archie| Hey [name]! Not sure where you are, but it’s definitely not the bunker. What do you see around you?
Archie| Wait… that sounds like… no, it can’t be. How did you even get in there?
Lilah| The security system must’ve failed when those… things showed up.
Archie| “Things”? Those are magnificent feats of engineering — born from The World Conductor itself!
Archie|They deserve some respect!
Lilah| Whatever you want to call them, they just took over our facility — and tried to kill us.
Lilah| Respect doesn’t really make the list for me.
Archie| I was just sayi—
Lilah| That thing is corrupt, Archie! It needs to be destroyed. I don’t care if it powers the whole planet —
Lilah| it has to go.
Archie| Okay, okay… no need to bite my head off.
Archie| What's that [name]?
Archie| Yeah, it sounds like you're in the secret lab. That’s supposed to be... well... secret...
Lilah| The electronic lock must’ve failed. Barricade the door and stay put, but—
Lilah| Do not touch anything in there, [name]. I repeat, do not touch anything!
Archie| Unless…
Lilah| Unless what?
Archie| Maybe it’s time.
Archie| The system’s stable enough—it was just waiting for a proper test run.
Lilah| We can’t just play with it like it’s some toy! 
Lilah| It hasn’t been fully tested, and we need authorization from the boss!
Archie| You really think he survived the attack? No one else did. There’s nowhere else secure in this building.
Archie| Tested or not, it’s our only hope. No one’s coming to save us.
Lilah| …
Lilah| …You’re right. I hate that you’re right.
Lilah| [name], listen carefully. You need to know what’s in that room.
Lilah| Six months ago, we started seeing strange electrical surges acting like they had a mind of their own.
Lilah| That’s when our team began developing a device to connect with The World Conductor itself.
Lilah| Remember that incident last month — the girl and the refrigerator? That was the turning point.
Lilah| We realized it could possess machines. So we armed the device.
Lilah| And now those same machines are destroying everything. They’re what attacked us.
Archie| The device, code-named S.U.R.G.E., is in there with you. See that blue orb?
Archie| We need you to pilot it. The controls only work from that lab.
Archie| Through it, you can reach The World Conductor. It may be humanity’s last shot.
Archie| I get it — you’re unsure. Anyone would be.
Lilah| But you’re the only one who can, [name]. Please. Do this.
Archie| We’ll be with you the whole way. Once S.U.R.G.E. boots up, we’ll see your display feed.
Lilah| …Thank you, [name]. You don’t know how much this means.
Lilah| Go to the control panel—I’ll guide you through it.
Lilah| Are you there? Good. See the button that says “Run Simulation”?
Lilah| Tap that — it’ll transport S.U.R.G.E. into a digital environment for training.
Archie| Don’t worry — it’s a lot at first, but you’ll get the hang of it. Even I managed it once!
Archie|
