Lilah|Welcome to the simulation room.
Lilah|This isn't real, just a way to get you familiar with the controls for S.U.R.G.E.
Lilah|You can move left and right using A and D or the arrow keys, give it a try.
Lilah|Great, now try pressing W or the up arrow to jump.
Archie|You can also double jump by pressing the same key while in midair!
Lilah|Be careful. See that meter at the bottom of your screen?
Lilah|That's your power meter, actions like jumping decrease your power. 
Lilah|If you run out, it's all over, so keep an eye on it.
Archie|Fortunately, those robots that keep showing up require power too, 
Archie|so it looks like The World Conductor has been giving them some supplies.
Archie|You should use this to your advantage.
Lilah|That's right, and if you need to get away in a hurry, there's also the dash feature.
Lilah|You can access it by pressing LSHIFT while moving left or right. Give it a try.
Lilah|Good job. 
Lilah|Of course, we didn't leave S.U.R.G.E defenseless, you've got 3 attacks to choose from:
Lilah|Firstly there's the weak pulse, its power cost is low, 
Lilah|but as the name implies, it is weak and only has a short range.
Lilah|Secondly, there's the strong blast. 
Lilah|This one is a long ranged projectile that packs a bit of a punch, but at a high cost.
Lilah|Lastly, there's the surround blast. This one is reasonably powerful, 
Lilah|but with a lower cost than the strong blast,
Lilah|It fires a round of short range projectiles in a ring around you.
Lilah|To cycle between these attacks, use [ and ]. 
Lilah|You can see your selected attack in the bottom left corner of your screen.
Lilah|Press SPACE to use your selected attack. There are a few enemies around for you to practice on.
Archie|Awesome work there [name], looks like you're almost ready to go. 
Archie|See if you can reach the end of the simulation using the controls we just taught you!
Archie|Once you're there we'll be ready to start the mission.
Archie|And before I forget, you can access the settings menu by pressing ESC.
Archie|There's a few things you can change there, 
Archie|including key remapping if you don't like how the controls feel!
