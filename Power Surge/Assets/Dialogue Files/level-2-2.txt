Archie|Keep moving forward, we're almost there!
Archie|The entrance should be just over there, let's take a look...
Archie|Yes! That's it right there!
Archie|There's uh... one issue though...
Lilah|...
Archie|I dunno how to open it
Lilah|You're kidding me!
Archie|Rumor has it there's some kind of puzzle to solve, I'd say it has something to do with that switch there
Archie|We went past another one just before
Lilah|Well that's a start at least.
Lilah|[name]. Archie and I will look into it.
Lilah|In the meantime, have a go at figuring it out yourself. I would suggest using an attack on one of those switches
Lilah|Alright [name], I couldn't find much, but...
Lilah|What?
Lilah|You've already got it open? How?
Lilah|Clearly you're more capable than we give you credit for. Keep going, we haven't got time to waste!
Lilah|
