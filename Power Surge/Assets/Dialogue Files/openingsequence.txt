Lilah|[name]! Hurry, get to the bunker!
Lilah|We haven't got long before they take over the building!
Lilah|[name]! Where are you?
Lilah|You're in the bunker?
Lilah|I'm in the bunker with Archie, but we don't see you...
Lilah|I'll put him on the hologram
Archie|Hey [name]! I'm not sure where you're at, but it's not the bunker, what can you see?
Archie|Huh? That sounds like the... but it can't be. How did you get in?
Lilah|The security system must have failed in the presence of those... those things...
Archie|I'm sorry, those things? Those are magnificent feats of engineering, forged in The World Conductor itself, 
Archie|they deserve some respect!
Lilah|Whatever you want to call them, they just took over our research facility...
Lilah|and tried to murder us in the process. 
Lilah|Not worthy of respect in my opinion.
Archie|I was just sayi...
Lilah|That thing is corrupt... it needs to be destroyed! I don't care that it provides all power to the world. 
Lilah|It's got to go.
Archie|Ok ok...
Archie|What's that [name]?
Archie|Well, it sounds like you're in the secret lab, it's supposed to be, well y'know, a secret.
Lilah|It seems that the electronic lock has failed, so barricade the door to keep yourself safe, but
Lilah|DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING IN THERE [name]. I REPEAT, DO NOT TOUCH!
Archie|Unless...
Archie|Maybe it's time?
Lilah|I'm sorry?
Archie|It's in a stable enough condition, it was just waiting on a proper test run.
Lilah|We can't just go ahead and play with it like it's some toy! 
Lilah|Not only has it not been fully tested, we need permission from the boss!
Archie|Surely you're kidding? There's no way he, or anyone else for that matter, survived the attack, 
Archie|there aren't any other secure spaces in the building.
Archie|Fully tested or not, it's our only hope. No one's coming to help.
Lilah|...
Lilah|... I hate to say this, but you're right.
Lilah|...
Lilah|[name], you need to know what's in that room.
Lilah|About 6 months ago, strange things started happening all over the world, all electricity related.
Lilah|It's as if the electricity itself were sentient. 
Lilah|That's when we put together a team of top scientists, to create a device that could allow us to reach 
Lilah|and interact with The World Conductor itself.
Lilah|You'll recall that incident last month with the girl and the refrigerator?
Lilah|Yeah, that's when we really knew something was up, so we added weapons.
Lilah|And as you know, in the last week, these machines have appeared, destroying everything in their path.
Lilah|That was them that just attacked us...
Archie|The device, we named S.U.R.G.E, is what's in that room with you, see that funky looking blue orb?
Archie|We need you to pilot it, the only way to access its controls is in that room.
Archie|You need to use it to gain access to The World Conductor. This could be humanity's last hope.
Archie|You're not sure about taking on the responsibility? Fair enough.
Lilah|[name], I know you're scared, but there's no other way. Please do this.
Archie|We'll be with you every step of the way. 
Archie|Once S.U.R.G.E is up and running, we'll be able to see your display.
Archie|...
Lilah|...
Lilah|... Thank you [name], you have no idea how important this is.
Lilah|Walk over to the control panel and I'll walk you through what to do.
Lilah|Are you at the control panel?
Lilah|Great, see that button on the screen that says "RUN SIMULATION"?
Lilah|Clicking that will transport S.U.R.G.E into a digital environment where you can practice controlling it.
Archie|There's a lot to learn, but it's not too hard once you get used to it, even I can do it!
