Lilah|This is as close as I could get you.
Lilah|Remember, we can see your screen so we can give advice as you go.
Archie|From what I can remember, continuing straight along here should lead you to the lab entrance.
Archie|Woah...
Archie|W..What???
Lilah|It looks like The World Conductor's done a bit of landscaping...
Lilah|I suspect those platforms will be safe to land on, just be careful.
Archie|What's that there? It looks important.
Lilah|I have no idea, but it could be useful. Try touching it, [name].
Lilah|Great. Now that S.U.R.G.E has added it to its inventory, Archie and I can inspect it further.
Lilah|If you see any more, make sure to grab them.
Lilah|Here we go, just as I expected. It's left some nasty bugs around to try and kill us.
Lilah|Kill it. NOW.
Archie|...
Archie|It looks like destroying that creature restored some of your power, cool!
Archie|Maybe don't go round killing all of them though, it would be fascinating to study them later on.
Lilah|As I predicted, there's a power source you can use, touching that should restore a good amount of power.
